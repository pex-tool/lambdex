# Release Notes

## 0.2.0

Lambdex.

This release fixes a bug wherein, when using the -o/--output option Lambdex would fail to write the
output file if the original input file was not writeable.

## 0.1.8

This release adds an -o/--output option, for when the input file can't be modified.

* An option to write the result to a new file. (#28)

## 0.1.7

This release brings official support for Python 3.10 and 3.11.

* Create arg that can specify module name. (#21)

## 0.1.5
